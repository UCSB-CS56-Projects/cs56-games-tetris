#Names
Juan Pacheco, Juan-Pacheco

a) Description:
   A popular puzzle game where the player lines up tiles/shapes into rows to eliminate them and gain points.
   An interactive Tetris game.

b) User Stories:
   As a player I can control where the pieces I have go in the orientation I prefer.
   As a player, I want to line them up across the row to eliminate the row and score points.
   As a player, I can drop the shape down faster if I want to.

c) Does it run?
   Yes, the program does run.
   It provies a graphical interface to play with like normal tetris, but has a few bugs, such as rotated block lingerance and no music.

d) Future User Stories:
   As a player, I would like to be able to rotate freely without leaving remnants of the shape onscreen breaking the game.
   As a player, I would enjoy being able to listen to the classic Tetris themes while playing.

e) Status of the README.md:
   The README.md is very well-written and helpful.
   It provides a brief history on the project and a recommendation on where to go from there.
   Also provides a list of bugs and suggestions.

f) Status of the Build.xml:
   The Build.xml has few comments that are more like instructions for the future people on the code rather that comments explaining. Not much else in the comments.
   Otherwise, it runs fine with all targets having a description.

g) Status on Issues:
   There are enough issues to be able to gain over 1000 points and are all doable given the time.
   In general, the issues are fairly clear in what they are asking for.

h) Additional Issues?
   We have not added any issues yet, but have some ideas.

i) Status of the code:
   All of the files(test, java, music) are all under the source file with no particular organization.
   The Block class has related subclasses, showing good use of inheritance/polymorphism.
   The relation between classes are clear with each other.
   The Type classes for the block could have better names as they are simply numbered.
   The TestBoard class seems to be cluttered with almost 1000 lines of code in it. There is a lot of potential for it to be refactored within it.

j) Status of the Tests:
   The tests seem to be poorly implemented because the block classes pass the rotate test despite not working properly in-game.
   There seems to be work needed in testing the game as they all "pass" despite the bugs that occur.

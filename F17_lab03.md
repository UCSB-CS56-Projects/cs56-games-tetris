a)**Description** Tetris is an interactive game where the player is given shapes and must organize them on a grid. Successfully organizing the shapes in a row rewards the player with points and eliminates the row.

b)**User Stories that Describe the Software**
As a player I am able to choose the difficulty.
As a player I am able to pause the gameplay.
As a player I am able to see my score.
As a player I am able to pause and play music.
As a player I am able to read the rules and controls.
As a player I am able to manipulate the orientation of the shapes.

c)**Does It Run** The software is able to run and open the main menu from where the user can choose the level of difficulty. After choosing a difficulty, the game of Tetris begins with a basic grid. Buttons are also placed next to the grid for different settings.

d)**User Stories and Future Features**
As a player, I want multiplayer so that the game is more competitive and social.
As a player, I want power ups (i.e. slow-motion, choose shape) to make the game more interactive.
As a player, I want shadow pieces so the the game is easier to play and more user friendly.
As a player, I want assetts to make the game more aesthetically pleasing.
As a player, I want the game to run smoothly so that I do not get upset.

e)**Quality of README** 
The README.md contains final remarks from previous contributors. It also includes suggestions and bugs experienced. What could make the README better would be to add bullet points to organize bugs, suggestions, and fixes; this allows future contributors to quickly glance at the current state of the project. Adding before and after images can also help to visualize the progress the project has taken.

f)**Quality of build.xml** 
The build.xml file successfully compiles and runs the game. It also creates the .jar file but not the javadoc file. It does not look like anything in the build.xml file needs to be removed. 

g)**Quality of Issues**
There are 15 open issues that are able to accumulate more than 1000 points. The issues are clear, containing titles and descriptions that accurately describe the problem.

h)**Additional Issues**
An issue that we encountered was that when completely reopening the game, the same two pieces (black squares) are the first to
 drop.

i)**Code Review** 
The code contains classes and methods that are properly named, making it clear what their purpose is. The relationship between classes is also clear. For example, the seven type classes (i.e. Type1.java) are the seven different pieces that appear in the game and are used in TetrisBoard.java. The previous contributors also provided comments on all their methods and classes, explaining their purpose. The code is easy to read but improvements can be made to improve organization. Inside of the TetrisBoard.java class, the controls for the game as well as the music class are implemented. Refactoring this would help with code readabilty and make the TetrisBoard.java class less cluttered. If we had to show one screenful of text to someone to get them caught up, it would contain all the class and method names. There would be no implementation but the class and method names are descriptive enough to provide a general sense of the program.

j)**Quality of Tests**
There are two test classes. One contains code that tests each of the seven types of tetris blocks. Each block (the Type classes) only has one test written for it, so more can be added to make testing more thorough. There is also a test written for the TetrisBoard.java class but it is not working, allowing us to greatly expand test coverage. To begin, we can create tests for the basic member fuctions such as moveDown() and deleteRows(). After these, we can move on to more complex member functions such as canMoveRight() and putBlock(). Making sure the buttons are working correctly is important as well, so implementing tests for them will ensure this. Refactoring the controls and audio classes is also helpful since we can then isolate them and right their own JUnit tests.

# Project00 : Sahil and Terrell


## To Do:
a) This project is a recreation of the popular block video-game known as Tetris.

b) As a user, I can change the difficulty of the game. As a user, I can pause the gameplay, As a user, I can view the rules for the game. As a user, I can control the music settings

c) The software runs, and the game is playable. However, there are small bugs where the block just splits apart. 

d) As a user, I can see more overall asthetic user interface. As a user, I can see a leaderboard of the highest scores.

e) Overall, the readme is very readable. Perhaps adding a brief overview of all the game's functionality at the top of the readme would be extremely helpful.

f) The current build.xml is high quality and very understandable. 

g) Yes, there are enough issues to where we can earn 1000 points. Yes the issues are fairly clear

h) The alert messages at the bottom of the screen take too long to update

i) The code is fairly decent. It is somewhat easy to get a good idea of what is happening in each segment of the code but in some areas it is not entirely readable. Although, there are an abundance of comments elaborating how the code behaves, I believe the code would benefit with additional comments. If we were to give someone a "screenful of text" to get them up to speed, we would give them a screenshot of the issues within the program, so they can understand the potential flaws of the code before they read it. 

j) There are JUnit tests implemented in this game. However, we believe that the test coverage is insufficient. For example, for the block test, we believe that there should be multiple tests for the creation of each block rather than a SINGLE test. If we were to expand test coverage we would add multiple tests for multiple types of blocks.
